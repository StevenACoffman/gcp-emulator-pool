# This is a Khan-academy specific yaml file that holds our pubsub config.
# It is used at deploy time to make sure all topics and subscriptions
# that our code uses, have been created on Google.
#
# The format of this file is a list of topics.  For each topic we list
# all the subscriptions that listen on the topic.  Each subscription
# includes its own configuration.  For instance, push subscriptions
# need the url-callback that will be called when something is
# published to that topic.  The url-callback should include the
# service-name that did the subscription, e.g.
#    https://mobile-data-dot-khan-academy.appspot.com/pubsub/mytopic
#
# Here is an example entry (though I hope you're not overriding this
# many defaults in real life!)
#   - topic: mytopic
#     subscriptions:
#       dataflow_reader:
#       python_reader:
#         endpoint: https://batch-dot-khan-academy.appspot.com/api/internal/pubsub/subscription/mytopic
#         ackDeadlineSeconds: 60
#         expirationTtl: 86400s
#         retainAckedMessages: true
#
# Unless overridden below, subscriptions use the following defaults:
#   * pull subscription (that is, no callback-url)
#   * ackDeadlineSeconds: 10
#   * expirationTtl: 2678400s   # 1 month
#   * messageRetentionDuration: 604800s
#   * retainAckedMessages: false
#
# Dev-Only subscriptions:
#   Certain subscriptions are set up for developer convenience.
#   These are named with a "devOnly_" prefix, and are used only
#   by the emulator for local testing purposes and are not set up
#   in prod.
#
# -- FINDING SUBSCRIPTIONS:
# I break this file into sections based on where I found
# the topics in our source code; each section says how I found the
# entries in it.  Here is how I found the subscriptions.
# 1) I found subs in python code via:
#       git grep -A2 '\<Subscription(' | grep -v _test.py | tr "'" '"' | grep '"' | grep -e 'Subscription(' -e '- *"' | cut -d'"' -f2 | sort -u
#    I had to look at the source code to find the topic for each subscription.
# 2) I found some subs in dataflow jobs via:
#       git grep -oh 'projects/khan-academy/subscriptions/[^"]*' '*.kts' | fgrep -v $ | sort -u | cut -d/ -f4
# 3) Many dataflow subscription-names had `$`s (variables) in them, so I
#    had to manually figure out what they actually were.  I did so via:
#       git grep -l 'projects/khan-academy/subscriptions/.*\$' '*/build.gradle.kts' | grep -v proto-log-stream- | xargs less
# In general, our source code (python) uses push subscriptions,
# which you can identify by the `endpoint` param.  Our dataflow
# jobs use pull subscriptions and lack an `endpoint` param.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------

# These topics are used by our Python code.  I found them via:
#    git grep -w -A2 -e PubSubTopic -e PubSubProtobufTopic | grep -v _test.py | tr "'" '"' | grep '"' | grep -e 'PubSubTopic(' -e 'PubSubProtobufTopic(' -e '- *"' | cut -d'"' -f2 | sort -u

# proto-log-stream-archiver and -export and -lake create a topic and
# subscription for every protobuf.  (NOTE: It's possible for users to
# manually override the default pubsub topic when starting these
# jobs on the commandline, but this config file is not responsible
# for managing those.)  I figured this out via:
#    git ls-files '**.proto' | xargs -iFOO basename FOO .proto | grep -v -e ^common -e ^google_python_key_ref | sort
# Unless used from python, each of these topics has two subscribers,
# one for the archiver and one for the exporter.  Their names

#     - subscription: sat_activity_log_event
